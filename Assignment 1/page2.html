    <P>Face/Off is a 1997 American science fiction[3][4][5] action thriller film[6][7] directed by John Woo, 
        written by Mike Werb and Michael Colleary, and starring John Travolta and Nicolas Cage.[8]
        The first Hollywood film in which Woo was given major creative control, 
        Face/Off earned critical acclaim for the performances by Cage and Travolta and its stylized action sequences. 
        The film earned $245 million worldwide, making it the 11th highest-grossing film of 1997, 
        and was nominated for an Academy Award for Sound Effects Editing (Mark Stoeckinger and Per Hallberg) 
        at the 70th Academy Awards. Since its release, 
        the film gained a strong cult following and it is considered by many as one of John Woo's best films</p>
