            You edit photos, surf the internet and watch your favorite movies with the 17-inch Lenovo IdeaPad 3 17ITL6 82H900YHMH. You also work in light programs, such as Adobe Photoshop or Office. The 11th generation Intel Core i5 processor and the 8 GB DDR4 RAM are strong enough for that. After your video call, you can easily close the webcam with the webcam slider. This way you can be sure that no one is watching. You can easily enter numbers and formulas on the numeric keyboard. Do you like to take your laptop outside on a sunny day? No problem. With the anti-reflective screen you are less affected by light. 
            With the card reader you can easily transfer files from, for example, your camera to your laptop.
