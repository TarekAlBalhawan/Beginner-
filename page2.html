            Play your favorite games on the 18-inch Asus ROG Strix G18 G814JI-N6079W. With the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 video card, you can play demanding games at at least 60 fps. 
            You can also stream your gameplay via Twitch in WQXGA, for example, thanks to the 13th generation Intel Core i9 processor and the 16 GB DDR5 RAM. 
            With the ROG Nebula screen you can enjoy a sharp image, a 3ms response time and 500 nits brightness. 
            This makes your game jump out of your screen. 
            Do you need more storage space after a while or do you want to multitask even more smoothly? Then you can easily expand the storage or working memory of this Asus. 
            In addition, the screen has a refresh rate of 240 hertz, so you can see fast-moving images smoothly. 
            This is especially useful in fast-paced shooters or racing games. Do you like to game in the evening? No problem. Adjust the keyboard lighting per key and continue gaming in style at night.
            
            Please note: always connect the charger while gaming, otherwise you will experience poorer performance and the battery will be empty within a few hours.
